# Check my new dotfiles on HyDE-dotfiles* 
* (*not a HyDE theme, just my own configuration with little scripts I made)
# TODO (Global [* including HyDE and ML4W])
* New wallpapers repo with updated wallpapers
* Unified install script (* One script to install either ML4W or HyDE)
* New branch with HyDE customizations. Currently present in https://github.com/YuvanMichaelVivenzi/HyDE-dotfiles (Will be integrated into this repo as a seperate branch.)
* New dock with changing themes for HyDE and pywal colors for ML4W.
# Important notice, ML4W-YMV setup is now in maintainance mode. 
* I have switched over to HyDE dotfiles which look quite good. I usually make dotfile changes like these every once a while. I'll maintain seperate branches like this.
* If I come across more dotfiles that I think will be a good addition. I'll keep updating.
* My own customizations made in seperate rices will be kept in maintainence mode.
* Like ML4W, there are other dotfiles that are probably bound to end up in maintainance mode.
* These "maintainence mode" things are usually stuff that I don't use anymore, but would like to keep updated. And probably switch to these every once a while when I get bored. These will typically be kept sure to work with the most recent versions as of now. I would encourage reporting issues and would love to get it fixed asap.
* Maintainance mode setups will recieve least of my attention, meaning it's stable, everything is expected to work and my interference would not be required as long as the upstrean ML4W repo doesn't make breaking changes. Again, if you experience any issues, literally anyrhing at all, please don't stop yourself from clicking that "issues" tab.
* I'm looking at some options to maintain and check multiple versions of these dotfiles. Anyways Stay Tuned!
* Some of the dotfiles I'm looking at,
* ML4W
* HyDE
* sane 1090x
* The Linux Cast
* DT (DistroTube)
* Chris Titus Tech (CTT)
* Others will be added when I come across them. 

# Installation
* Install regular ml4w from https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles
* Have a terminal ready
* Copy and paste "hypr" and "waybar" folders from this repo into their respective locations. *Beware of breaking symlinks!
* Make all scripts executable
* Reboot!

# Stay tuned for more improvements!


# TODO (For ML4W-YMV)
## 1. Add a dock that looks beautiful and integrates pywal colors.
## 2. Make a working install script. 

An advanced configuration of Hyprland for Arch Linux based distributions. This package includes an installation script to install and setup the required components.

* The images below are slightly outdated. But should give a rough idea of how they look. 
* The images are of ml4w's dotfiles. Mine are slightly different
* I'll update the images once I think I'm ready to showcase my fully customized product.

These dotfiles are available to clone, use personally or professionally. I don't care, make your linux rig as good as you want it to be. Probably would like my name in credits. (Not required.) (Just to keep me motivated on this project)

## Installation *(FOLLOW THE INSTALLATION HEADING AT THE TOP OF THIS README. The method below is outdated.) 

* The installation should work on all Arch Linux based distributions. (NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK ON ARCH LINUX DERIVATIVES) * ONLY VANILLA ARCH. 

The easiest way is to use the setup.sh script. The script will download all files from Github and start the installation automatically.

Just copy/enter the following command into your terminal.

```
bash <(curl -s https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles/-/raw/main/setup.sh)
```

### Caution when getting keyboard layout selected, you may get German keyboard layout like I did the first time I tried this. Please reconfigure your keyboard in the script and proceed during installation. 

> PLEASE NOTE: Every Linux distribution, setup and personal configuration can be different. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the ML4W Dotfiles will work everywhere. Installation at your own risk.

## Wallpapers

All wallpapers that I use are provided in the "wallpapers" directory of this repo. 

## Thanks to
### ML4W (Stephan Raabe) for his dotfiles and his great service to linux customization. And to everyone else who helped him.
